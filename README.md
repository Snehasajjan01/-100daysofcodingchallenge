100 Days of Code - Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Challenge dedicated to improving your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills! This repository is designed to provide you with a structured and effective way to enhance your understanding of DSA concepts and coding skills over the course of 100 days.


Overview:
This challenge is aimed at both beginners and intermediate-level programmers who want to master DSA for coding interviews, or just to become better problem solvers. The goal is to consistently practice and learn new concepts each day for 100 days.

Prerequisites,
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

A basic understanding of programming fundamentals in a language of your choice (e.g., Java, C++).
An account in Leetcode , CodeStudio or GeeksForGeeks

Repository Structure
/100DAYSOFCODE: Contains a subdirectory for each day of the challenge (e.g., /Day1, /Day2, etc.). Each day's directory will have a Java file with specific questions or links to those questions with solutions for the day. You can expect to find three problems for each day as you aim to solve three problems daily.

Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to this repository by:

Adding new DSA challenges and exercises.
Improving existing solutions.
Providing feedback or suggestions for improvement.
Helping fellow participants by reviewing their code and offering guidance.
To contribute, please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

This challenge is inspired by the #100DaysOfCode movement.

Disclaimer
This challenge is meant for educational purposes and self-improvement. While it can be a valuable resource for preparing for coding interviews, it is important to supplement your learning with other resources and real-world practice.

Happy coding, and best of luck with your 100 Days of Code journey! ðŸš€
